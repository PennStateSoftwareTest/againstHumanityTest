1. Install istanbul with npm
  npm install --save istanbul
2. Updated package.json so I could run "npm test"
  Add to "scripts" section, istanbul calls jasmin-node to run the tests
3. Ran tests the first time to see coverage
  Noticed no test coverage for the departGame function
4. Added a test for if one player leaves the game
  Noticed increase in test coverage with new test
